# Me-Me-Inn
An Android app aimed at improving users' engagement in vocabulary learning through a ranked ladder-climbing competition system.

# Description
The current tools that help people learn vocabulary suffers from the problem that learners lose interests and motivation as time elapses. Hence we produce a solution to this problem by adding in excitement of competition into the learning process. We propose an online game that employs the idea of friendly competition. A set number of questions will be tossed out and the two players would race to answer them; their score would be based on their answersâ€™ correctness and speed.

# Demo
The app is still in its development stage. For a demo of the app, you can download the debug.apk and install it on an Android device. If you don't own an Android device, we recommend trying out [App Runtime for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/getstarted_arc) which allows you to run Android apps on Chrome. It's considerably faster than Android Emulators.
